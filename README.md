# Hi there, I’m Pati — aka PatriHow  
*Front-End Developer · UX/UI Designer · WordPress Specialist*

I’m a **front-end developer and UX/UI designer** based in Montréal, with **7+ years of experience in digital design** and a strong focus on **custom WordPress and CMS-driven websites**.

I specialize in bridging **design systems, accessibility, and front-end development** to deliver scalable, maintainable, and user-centered web experiences.  
My background allows me to collaborate seamlessly with designers, developers, and non-technical teams.

I recently completed my specialization in web design and front-end development (October 2025) and finished my professional internship in December 2025. I am now fully focused on front-end and WordPress development projects.
